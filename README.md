# 🌊 Hidden Currents: Edge AI for Water Accountability in U.S. Power Plants

**Detecting Risk in Cooling System Data**
*(formerly *Resource Ripple*, renamed April 10, 2025)*

## 🧭 Project Overview

**Toward climate-resilient infrastructure: modeling gaps in U.S. power plant water data to support future Edge AI tools.**

This project analyzes thermoelectric cooling data from U.S. power plants (EIA Forms 860 & 923, 2015–2023) to surface structural issues in water usage reporting. The goal is to identify patterns in data quality and anomaly risk that could inform lightweight, real-time anomaly detection models—especially as water becomes a more strained and politicized resource.

### Key Focus Areas

* Completeness and consistency of cooling system records
* Missing or implausible values as indicators of deeper accountability gaps
* Operational features that may correlate with inconsistent reporting
* Early steps toward a feature-weighted “suspicion score” for future ML modeling

This work lays the groundwork for AI-assisted environmental monitoring by clarifying the data landscape—and its blind spots—before committing to predictive modeling.

## ⚠️ A Note on Data Flags

Several engineered columns represent *anomaly flags* (e.g., missing values, implausible zeros, suspicious duplicates). These are **not model outputs**, but exploratory tools to identify where reporting may diverge from expected behavior based on plant features like cooling type or fuel source.
