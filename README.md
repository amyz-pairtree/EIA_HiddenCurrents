# 🌊 Edge AI for Water Accountability in U.S. Power Plants  
**Hidden Currents in Cooling Systems**  
*(formerly "Resource Ripple"; renamed April 10, 2025)*

## 🧭 Project Description  
**Toward climate-resilient infrastructure: modeling gaps in water data to support future Edge AI accountability tools.**

This project analyzes U.S. power plant cooling system data (EIA Forms 860 & 923, 2015–2023) to explore the intersection of energy generation, water usage, and data transparency. The core objective is to develop a predictive model that flags facilities or states potentially in need of support or oversight—based on patterns in thermoelectric cooling system reporting.

### Focus Areas
- Structure and completeness of reported cooling system data  
- Treatment of missing or inconsistent entries as meaningful signals  
- Detection of systemic patterns that may reflect operational, logistical, or regulatory blind spots

Ultimately, this work supports the prototyping of Edge AI tools for real-time, environmentally efficient water management—a step toward sustainable infrastructure in a climate-vulnerable era.

### Note on Missingness Flags  
Several derived columns explicitly model data gaps in reported cooling metrics. These features are detailed under each table and serve as early indicators of potential issues in reporting and accountability.
