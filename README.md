(New direction: Apr.10,2025) Hidden Currents: Missing Data in U.S. Cooling Systems

Project Description
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify power plants or states that may require assistance or oversight in their thermoelectric cooling system reporting and accountability. 

This project: 
- Uses data from the EIA Cooling and Boiler Reports (Forms 860 & 923) from 2015–2023 
- Focuses on the structure and completeness of reported cooling system information 
- Treats missing or inconsistent data ("missingness") as a predictive feature, not just a nuisance 
- Aims to identify facilities or regions where data anomalies may reflect operational, logistical, or regulatory gaps 

Ultimately, this modeling could support the development of Edge AI systems to aid in real-time, environmentally efficient water management in energy generation—a step toward more resilient and sustainable infrastructure in the face of climate change.

Note on derived columns: Several fields in this model are explicitly designed to capture patterns of missingness in EIA-reported cooling data. These features are listed beneath tables under ‘Missingness Flags’ and are used as potential indicators of systemic issues in plant-level reporting.

**Project Description:** Analysis of U.S. Electricity Power Plants and Water Usage (2015-2023) using EIA Datasets. This project explores the intersection of energy and water consumption.
**Update (March 31, 2025):** Water usage analysis is pending due to time constraints for domain knowledge acquisition and further data wrangling.
